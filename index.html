<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>My research is at the intersection of concretely efficient
cryptography and machine learning. I am primarily interested in
designing methods that use zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty
computation to audit and verify the <em>trustworthyness</em> of machine
learning models.</p>
<p>Cryptographic verification creates an avenue of accountability for ML
service providers, even in the presence of misaligned incentives and/or
adversarial behavior. It also allows service providers build trust by
<em>actively</em> attesting that their models are trustworthy, without
revealing any information about user data or proprietary model
parameters. My published works in this line include methods for
cryptographic verification of fairness using zero-knowledge proofs

<p>I have also worked in data-driven computational biology. I designed
an ML method to improve clinical accessibility of
mutational-signature-based cancer diagnostics

extracting signaling pathways from protein-protein interaction data

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>
<p>Teaching is the thing that drives me to be an academic. The quality
of my teaching is extremely important to me. Below are some of my
experiences in undergraduate teaching and mentorship.</p>

Assembly, and C++.</li>
<li>selected student comments
(<a href="csci221_student_evaluations_s2023">full course evaluation
here</a>):
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
“I loved the energy of the lectures and the learning environment, the
professor’s enthusiasm in providing help in lab, and the effectiveness
of the assignment material at both closely matching the subjects
discussed in lecture while providing sufficient practice to reinforce
learning. The midterm exam was also extremely well-designed and well-
structured - in fact, it felt like one of the most accurately balanced
exams I have taken at Reed. I would retain the majority of the course
structure and policies - I feel that the course accomplished exactly
what it is meant to, with the appropriate scope at all steps of the
process, and with effective measures in place to ensure students have a
good experience.”
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
“I liked Olive’s teaching style! She was always super prepared,
organized, cheerful, and engaged during lectures and labs. The policy of
going and offering help unsolicited during labs was very helpful for
folks such as I who struggle asking for help for any reason ever. Asking
questions unsolicited during lecture helped for this exact same reason,
it never felt like being singled out or stressful as the answer “I don’t
know” was never punished. It was clear that she cares, not just whether
the students learned the material, but also whether we [were] generally
mentally well. I felt respected and appreciated every day I showed up to
class, and though I’ve stopped going out of my way to give a 110 percent
in college, this class was the one exception.”
