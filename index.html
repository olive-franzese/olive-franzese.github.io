<p>My work is about auditing AI/ML systems without leaking sensitive
information, by using secure cryptographic protocols. This allows
auditors to provably verify that AI/ML systems are reliable, unbiased,
and privacy-preserving, even in the presence of

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal">behavior</a>.
It also allows service providers build trust by <em>actively</em>
attesting that their models are trustworthy, without revealing any
information about user data or proprietary model parameters. I believe
techniques like these are integral building blocks for effective
regulation of AI/ML.</p>

<h2 id="teaching-mentorship">Teaching &amp; Mentorship</h2>
<p>Teaching and mentoring students is very important to me. In my
pedagogy, I aim to expose the deep and compelling questions that
underlie computing, rather than just teaching about the specifics of
computing systems themselves. I take a lot of inspiration from the
writings of contemporary mathematics educator
<a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~pawelst/rzut_oka/Zajecia_dla_MISH_2011-12/Lektury_files/LockhartsLament.pdf">Paul
Lockhart</a>, and seek to apply his insights in computer science
education. I am especially interested in the developing role of
computing as part of a liberal arts education. I think we are in great
need of computing practitioners who can reason about the social context
surrounding computing, in addition to programs themselves. I think a
liberal arts education is exactly the right place to cultivate students
with mastery of both. I was on the ACM SIGSCE 2025

Computing Education in Liberal Arts Colleges</a>. Below are some of my
experiences in undergraduate teaching and mentorship.</p>

<li>selected student comments:
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<em>“I loved the energy of the lectures and the learning environment,
the professor’s enthusiasm in providing help in lab, and the
effectiveness of the assignment material at both closely matching the
subjects discussed in lecture while providing sufficient practice to
reinforce learning. The midterm exam was also extremely well-designed
and well- structured - in fact, it felt like one of the most accurately
balanced exams I have taken at Reed. I would retain the majority of the
course structure and policies - I feel that the course accomplished
exactly what it is meant to, with the appropriate scope at all steps of
the process, and with effective measures in place to ensure students
have a good experience.”</em>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<em>“I liked Olive’s teaching style! She was always super prepared,
organized, cheerful, and engaged during lectures and labs. The policy of
going and offering help unsolicited during labs was very helpful for
folks such as I who struggle asking for help for any reason ever. Asking
questions unsolicited during lecture helped for this exact same reason,
it never felt like being singled out or stressful as the answer “I don’t
know” was never punished. It was clear that she cares, not just whether
the students learned the material, but also whether we [were] generally
mentally well. I felt respected and appreciated every day I showed up to
class, and though I’ve stopped going out of my way to give a 110 percent
in college, this class was the one exception.”</em>
